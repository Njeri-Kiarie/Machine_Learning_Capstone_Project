# Predicting Student Course Completion in Online Learning Platforms.

## Project Overview

Online learning platforms have transformed access to education by enabling learners to acquire new skills anytime and anywhere. Despite this growth, one of the biggest challenges faced by EdTech platforms is low course completion rates. Many learners enroll in courses but fail to complete them due to factors such as low engagement, poor study habits, or competing commitments.

This project aims to develop a machine learning classification model that predicts whether a student is likely to complete an online course based on their learning behavior, engagement, demographic characteristics, and course-related features. By identifying learners at risk of dropping out early, educational institutions and online learning platforms can implement targeted interventions to improve student success and course completion rates.

## Problem Statement

Online learning providers often struggle to identify students who are at risk of not completing their courses before they disengage. Traditional monitoring methods rely on manual tracking or identifying students only after they have already fallen behind, limiting opportunities for timely intervention.

The objective of this project is to build a predictive machine learning model that can classify whether a student will **complete** or **not complete** a course using historical student engagement and performance data. The insights generated from this model can support proactive decision-making, improve learner retention, and enhance the overall effectiveness of online education.

## Machine Learning Workflow

The project will follow a structured machine learning pipeline:

### 1. Data Understanding
- Load and inspect the dataset
- Explore data types and feature distributions
- Identify missing values and duplicates

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze the distribution of the target variable
- Explore relationships between features
- Identify trends, patterns, and potential predictors
- Detect outliers and data inconsistencies

### 3. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values
- Encode categorical variables
- Scale numerical features where necessary
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets

### 4. Model Development
Train and compare multiple classification models, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

### 5. Model Evaluation
Evaluate model performance using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix

### 6. Model Interpretation
- Analyze feature importance
- Identify the key factors influencing course completion
- Generate actionable insights for educators and platform administrators

## Expected Outcome and Impact

The final outcome of this project will be a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting whether a student is likely to complete an online course.

The project aims to support EdTech platforms and educational institutions by enabling:

- Early identification of students at risk of dropping out
- Personalized learning interventions and support
- Improved student engagement and retention
- Higher course completion rates
- Better allocation of academic support resources
- Data-driven decision-making for instructors and administrators

Ultimately, this project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to improve learner success and enhance the effectiveness of online education through predictive analytics.
